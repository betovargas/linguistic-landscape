*Linguistic Landscape*

>#####  â€¦language in the environment, words and images displayed and exposed in public spaces, that is the center of attention in this rapidly growing area referred to as Linguistic Landscape (LL). *(Shohamy and Gorter, 2008)*


Linguistic Landscapes of Philadelphia is a project by Linguistic Diversity, a linguistics course led by Dr. Miranda Weinberg at Swarthmore College. Students explored language in a range of environments around the city of Philadelphia. Individually, each Story Map shows one or two students' walks through a part of the city and their reflections on language in that public space.

Individually, each walk is a snapshot of a particular area. Taken together, they show us a view of linguistic diversity in Philadelphia, from political graffiti to hipster advertising; from tourist sites to community-oriented markets. We invite you to explore the maps, to look with fresh eyes at your linguistic and semiotic surroundings.
